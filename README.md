## Hi, I'm Hiyab 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building machine learning pipelines. Check out my work (<a href="">here</a>)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make sure I employ data engineering best practices like using Apache Airflow for data orchestration in all my end-to-end data pipeline projects.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
   - End-to-end data pipeline projects (especially those supporting NGOs or humanitarian causes).
   - Machine learning projects particularly fraud detection pipelines that combine supervised learning with anomaly detection (hybrid model approaches)

- =>❓ Motivation & project interest

  -> With a long history of supporting NGOs as a volunteer and coming from a conlict-ridden area, I am deeply passionate about  
  -> supporting NGOs and generally projects with a humanitarian cause. Additionally, working on NGO projects are quite interesting!  
  -> There are usually several datasets, limitations to consider and ambiguity to navigate prompting for creative data solutions. As for   
  -> fraud detection machine learning projects, I find it exciting to work on pipelines where hybrid model approaches (supervised + anomaly detection) can be applied to tackle critical real-world problems.

If you want to collaborate or have other ideas, don't hesitate to reach out! 

P.S. ✨ Bonus points if you recognise the `=>` and `->` usage 👀
